WIF - Workload identity Federation

With identity federation, you can use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant external identities IAM roles, 
including the ability to impersonate service accounts. 
This lets you access resources directly, using a short-lived access token, and eliminates the maintenance and security burden associated with service account keys.
