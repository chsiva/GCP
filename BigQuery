# Serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective multi-cloud data warehouse designed for business agility.

1. New customers get $300 in free credits to spend on Google Cloud during the first 90 days. 
2. All customers get 10 GB storage and up to 1 TB queries/month, completely free of charge.

# Today, we are introducing BigQuery Omni,
a flexible, multi-cloud analytics solution that lets you cost-effectively access and securely analyze data across Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS),
and Azure (coming soon), without leaving the familiar BigQuery user interface (UI). 
Using standard SQL and the same BigQuery APIs our customers love, you will be able to break down data silos and gain critical business insights from a single pane of glass. And because BigQuery Omni is powered by Anthos, you will be able to query data without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
