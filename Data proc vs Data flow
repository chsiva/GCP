Google Cloud Dataflow is a fully-managed, scalable data processing service for executing batch, stream, and ETL processing patterns. 
Cloud Dataflow frees you from operational tasks like resource management and performance optimization, handles out-of-order data, and is integrated with other GCP and open source technology.

# Features:

1. With your existing MapReduce, you can operate on an immense amount of data each day without any overhead worries.
2. With the in-built monitoring system, you can transfer your cluster data to your applications. You can get quick-reports from the system and also have the feature of storing data in Googleâ€™s BigQuery.
3. Quick launch and delete smaller clusters stored in blob storage, as and when required using Spark (Spark SQL, PySpark, Spark shell).
4. Spark Machine Learning Libraries and Data Science to customize and run classification algorithms.
